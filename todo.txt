Functionality checklist:
    - OK ===> Translatable
    - OK ===> Dark and light themes
    - Set group as locked so it ignores changes (sorta like a bookmark group)
    - Add tooltips
    - Consider more animations (like animating export button on finished)
    - Consider a secondary color (like blue) for buttons, hightlight...
    - Support chrome groups
    - Replace chrome storage for indexedDB

Bug fixes:
    - When user tabs right creation page input is focused and makes it move
    - Restoring session unlinks windows and groups. Maybe test if all restored tabs are equal to all group tabs
    - Check what happens when a tab is moved from one window to another
    - When oppening browser group is correctly binded but a tab is added. This happens when the closed window id binded to group is the same as the new one. Maybe binding id values should be cleaned on startup.
    - When reseting windowIds in onStartup, the window onCreate event is not affected
    - Closing a window triggers the remove tag event. This is not the intentional behavior

DB structure for chrome.storage:
    - Two types of structures: tabGroups and tabs. Each is a top level object with db key => id
    - Two array structures, one for tabGroups and one for tabs that collects ids of each structs
    - To retreive all, check ids in arrays and pull those from DB
    - To make the parent-child relationship there needs to be an array attr in tabgroups and an string attr in tabs for ids
